# Elevator saga

https://play.elevatorsaga.com/

Many many years ago I had cause to try and write some elevator control software for a little project.

I've forgotten the details, but have had fond memories of it as a challenge; and then a good few years ago
read a really interesting article about someone who ran elevators in Hong Kong, I think - with some serious 
challenges.

So the interest kept going - and then I ran across this website and thought ... let's give it a try.

### details

It's deceptively hard. Challenge 1 was OK, challenge 2 goes straight into it, so I'm dreading the later ones <grin>

Oh, and I don't do Javascript normally, sorry.
